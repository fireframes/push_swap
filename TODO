1. Get the input data and store it to a doubly linked list stack_a.
			- check args
			- check if sorted
			- check if more than 1

			* better to have 1

			- check for empty, alphabetical, special chars


2. Implement sorting operations functions:

##
			## sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.
			## 	Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.

			### assign the head pointer to node2

##
			## sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.
			## 	Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
##
			## ss : sa and sb at the same time.
##
			## pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
			## 	Do nothing if b is empty.
##
			## pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
			## 	Do nothing if a is empty.
##
			## ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.
			## 	The first element becomes the last one.
##
			## rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.
			## 	The first element becomes the last one.
##
			## rr : ra and rb at the same time.
##
			## rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.
			## 	The last element becomes the first one.
##
			## rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.
			## 	The last element becomes the first one.
##
			## rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.

3. Implement sorting algorithm optimal for 2, 3 and 5 elems.

4. Optimize algo Big O
